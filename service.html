                Over the course of my college journey, I have had a hard time finding opportunities to give back to the community through volunteering or service. However,
                in the spring of 2024, I was informed about undergraduate positions in peer teaching and teaching assistant. 
                <p>
                    This was an opportunity I thought I never had as one of the required credits to graduate was an <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/undergraduate/engrx/index.html">ENGR<sup>[x]</sup></a>
                    credit. I thought to myself: "Wow, I guess I'll just research something random, and hopefully a professor would help..." This was something I planned since the beginning
                    of my sophomore year at TAMU.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This plan changed drastically as I was accepted as an undergraduate teaching assistant for CSCE120/121, an entry-level computer science class focused on C++ basics.
                    I personally thought I couldn't do it, as I was:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easily anxious in social situations</li>
                        <li>Deeply introverted</li>
                        <li>A terrible public speaker (personal opinion)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite these traits, I pushed to do my best in helping students understand the content during labs and maybe share a bit of knowledge of how certain C++ things work.
                    While the semester has barely started, I currently feel at ease handling labs for my section and excited when they ask questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe I'll continue to TA for this class in future semesters. I really do enjoy answering questions they have, and I wouldn't mind if new students ask me these same questions again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Down the line, maybe I'll see if the courses I've taken need TAs. Most, if not all teaching assistants have been integral in helping me learn concepts of higher problem classes.
                    That combined with the relatability of undergraduate TAs creates purposeful interactions I wish to give back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It might not be realistic to balance TA-ing and senior coursework, but it's something I wish to do to give back to those who helped me along the way.
