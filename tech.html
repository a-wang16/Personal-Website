                Many of these are just a work-in-progress or planned, but here are a few noteworthy ones!
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://github.com/PotatoCurry/orbital-simulator">Orbital Simulator</a>: My first collaborative project written in Python simulating 
                        the physics of the four inner planets. The simulation can run in real-time or up to 1,000,000x speed.

                    <li>
                        Custom Discord Bot: A private repository which was my first look into the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference">Discord API</a>, a popular social platform
                        I utilize. An earlier project with many errors, this was one of the first steps into the coding scene and sparked a passion to combine fun, interactivity, programming, and utility.
                        Written in Python and currently hosted on a personal server.

                        (WIP) HTTP Web Crawler/ScuffedCrawler: A C++ project for my Networks and Distributed Processing class that utilizes HTTP1.0 calls. 
                        Utilizes <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-socket">Windows-based sockets </a> to connect
                        to a list of URLs that run on the HTTP protocol. Supports multiple threads and respects the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt">Robots Exclusion Protocol.</a>
                        Does not include HTTPS protocols.

                        (Planned) Custom Raytracing Engine: An engine utilizing CMake and C++ that mimics graphical raytracing. The final project of the Computer
                        Graphics course alongside other rendering projects.

                    <li>
                        (Planned) Project V: A custom face-tracking software utilizing NVIDIA to track a virtual avatar through the tracking of facial features. A marriage between
                        a hobby of mine and programming, this project helps create a bridge to fine-tune virtual avatar software into accepting or enabling a larger range of expressions.

                        (Planned) Project Âµ: A rhythm-based hack-and-slash game utilizing the Godot engine. This project is one of my biggest ambitions as I hope to self-publish this
                        game in a clean and polished state. Inspired by <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/">Hades</a> the game and 
                        <a href="https://bethesda.net/en-US/game/hifirush">Hi-Fi RUSH</a>, I plan to develop an in-depth world of characters with rhythmic concepts implemented as power-ups 
                        or combat mechanics. <br> I plan to do both the creative and technical designs of this game.
